# Automated Checks for Image Annotation Quality
Image Annotations have been checked programmatically using this code. Different checks are implemented to check different error sources. 4 different checks have been used in this code as of now.
More robust checks can be added in the future and the different parameters involved in the current 4 checks can be tuned to make them better
